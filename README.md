# MATLAB Plotting and Linear Systems

A curated collection of MATLAB scripts and resources for basic and advanced plotting, as well as visualizations and solutions of linear systems of equations.

## About

This repository serves as a learning and reference hub for MATLAB users interested in both fundamental and sophisticated plotting techniques. It also focuses on the graphical interpretation and solution of linear systems of equations, making mathematical concepts more intuitive through visualization.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic Plots**
  - Line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.
  - Customizing axes, titles, legends, and annotations
- **Advanced Plotting**
  - 3D plots, surface and mesh plots, contour plots
  - Multiple plots in a single figure, subplots, advanced styling
  - Animated plots and dynamic visualization
- **Linear Systems of Equations**
  - Visualization of solution spaces for 2x2 and 3x3 systems
  - Geometric interpretation of lines and planes
  - MATLAB solutions using built-in functions (e.g., linsolve, inv, \ operator)
  - Plotting intersection points, parallel/no solution cases, and infinite solutions

## Structure
